Cel.ai Example: Logic Router Experimental
------------------------------------------

This is a simple example of an AI Assistant implemented using the Cel.ai framework.
It serves as a basic demonstration of how to get started with Cel.ai for 
creating intelligent assistants.

Framework: Cel.ai
License: MIT License

This script is part of the Cel.ai example series and is intended for educational purposes.

Usage:
------
Configure the required environment variables in a .env file in the root directory of the project.
The required environment variables are:
- NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN: The Ngrok authentication token. You can get this from the Ngrok dashboard.
- TELEGRAM_TOKEN: The Telegram bot token for the assistant. You can get this from the BotFather on Telegram.
- OPENAI_API_KEY: The OpenAI API key for the assistant. You can get this from the OpenAI dashboard.

Then run this script to see a basic AI assistant in action.

Note:
-----
Please ensure you have the Cel.ai framework installed in your Python environment prior to running this script.
